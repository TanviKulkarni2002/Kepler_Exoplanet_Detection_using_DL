Classifying data points from Kepler space telescope as exoplanets or false positives using LSTM and CNN algorithms. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) was used for synthetic data generation was also performed to improve the performance of the models.
Two different datasets were used for the same set of algorithms. Datasets were acquired through Kaggle.
